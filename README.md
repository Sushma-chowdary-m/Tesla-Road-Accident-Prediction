# Tesla-Road-Accident-Prediction
The Tesla Road Accident Prediction focuses on predicting fatalities related to Tesla vehicles using logistic regression. 
Tesla, known for its innovative electric vehicles, has seen an increase in accidents and fatalities over recent years, prompting the need for predictive modeling to enhance safety measures. 
Logistic regression is chosen for its effectiveness in binary classification tasks, making it suitable for predicting the likelihood of fatal outcomes in Tesla accidents based on various input features.


In conclusion, the Tesla Road Accident Prediction project demonstrates the impactful application of logistic regression in predicting fatalities in Tesla accidents based on essential parameters. 
The logistic regression model achieved an overall accuracy of approximately 90%, indicating that it correctly predicted the outcome for a majority of the instances in the dataset. Further the EDA analysis gives us a clear picture which states that USA, followed by China and Germany, reported the highest number of accidents annually. 
In USA the thighest number of deaths in a state is shown as California. 
Even the further analysis led path to identifying that in the year 2021  the highest number of deaths  where reported.
Through thorough analysis of real-world data and the development of a predictive model, valuable insights have been gained into the factors influencing fatal outcomes in Tesla vehicles.
The model's robust accuracy and reliability in identifying potential risks underscore its potential to enhance safety protocols and promote safer driving behaviors.
